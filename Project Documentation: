Project Documentation: Visual Testing of 
Justinmind Website 
1. Overview 
This project focuses on visual testing of the Justinmind website. The goal is to ensure 
that the user interface across all pages is visually consistent, free of rendering issues, 
and adheres to design specifications. 
The website under test consists of four main pages: 
• Home Page 
• Templates Page 
• Pricing Page 
• Download Page 
2. Objectives 
• Verify that all UI components render correctly across different browsers and 
devices. 
• Detect any layout shifts, broken styles, or misaligned elements. 
• Ensure visual consistency between design mockups and the implemented 
website. 
• Automate visual regression testing where possible. 
3. Scope 
The scope of testing includes: 
• Static elements: Headers, footers, navigation menus, buttons, and text. 
• Dynamic elements: Hover states, dropdowns, and interactive components. 
• Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari. 
• Responsive testing: Desktop, tablet, and mobile views. 
4. Tools & Frameworks 
• Visual Testing Tools: 
o Playwright / typescript (for automation) 
• Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari 
• Devices: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile 
5. Test Strategy 
• Baseline Capture: Take initial screenshots of all four pages. 
• Comparison Runs: Compare new builds against baseline screenshots. 
• Regression Testing: Run automated visual checks after each deployment. 
• Manual Review: Perform exploratory testing to catch subtle visual issues. 
6. Reporting 
• Defect Tracking: Issues logged in Jira/Trello with screenshots. 
• Test Reports: Generated after each test cycle with pass/fail status. 
7. Conclusion 
This project ensures that the Justinmind website maintains a consistent, professional, 
and user-friendly visual experience across all supported platforms. Visual testing 
helps prevent UI regressions and enhances overall usability.
